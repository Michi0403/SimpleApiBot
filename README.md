# SimpleApiBot
Wrote it intentional for icq, is pretty adaptable

Intention for this was to build a adaptable .net Api runner (bot) with these features
-easy implement complex structures (or avoid it)
-Serializeable Interfaces/abstracts to store, commands, responses, requests, whatever
-Make parts easy replaceable (well, atm I not splitted the assembly but it's coming)
-Write it without using Any stuff which is not .Net5 (to keep option for using it on other platforms)
-Create own certs to use Https by wanted standard

It's nothing special but, I like it :)

There are a lot naming issues and so on but it's production code so I am "Pretty Sowwy"
